polyfit uses recursive least squares to perform a polynomial regression (i.e.
it fits a polynomial to a set of data points without requiring a large buffer).
For details on the math behind this recursive least squares implementation, see
Gentlemen & Kung's famous 1981 paper entitled ["Matrix triangularization by
systolic arrays"](http://goo.gl/kwPE8d).
